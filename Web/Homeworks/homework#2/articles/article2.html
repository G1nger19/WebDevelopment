                    <h2><b>Add Value</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        Adding value to yourself 
                        is a good foundation to begin 
                        your journey to being rich. 
                        Develop some knowledge or 
                        skills that justify someone 
                        paying you a good amount of 
                        money. Convince people that 
                        you are worth a large paycheck 
                        because you will add value to 
                        their lives in return.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h2><b>Tax Yourself</b></h2>

                        A different way of looking at your 
                        savings is to view them as taxes. 
                        Once you pay your taxes, you never get 
                        the whole amount back. Treat your savings 
                        the same way. Set money aside in a savings 
                        account or transfer it to a totally separate 
                        account where you cannot touch it. Treat your 
                        savings like money that you will never get back, 
                        until the day that you get it all back at once.
