            <h1>How to communicate with foreigners?</h1>

            <h2>Show respect! (By saying "vy" in Czech.) </h2>
            <p>
                If you talk with your employees 
                in Czech, talk to them in such a 
                way in which you would like to be 
                approached yourself. The Czech that 
                they will learn at work is most 
                probably the language they will use 
                when speaking to you and when speaking 
                elsewhere.
            </p>

            <h2>"Yes" does not always mean yes. </h2>
            <p>
                Although it may drive us crazy, 
                there are cultures where it is 
                inappropriate to disagree with 
                superiors or people of a higher-ranking 
                in society or where a question is 
                automatically responded to in a positive way.
